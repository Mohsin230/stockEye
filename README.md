* Had done twitter api in a personal project and some work in sentiment analysis, so I proposed a program where stock market investors can look at which stocks are being talked about a lot recently on social media sites such as twitter and google
* Would provide a rating on how positive or negative social media sites are reacting to a given stock
* Made in response to at the time huge rise of gamestopsâ€™ stock and how people realized that if you can follow the online trends and get a better grasp of what stocks are being hyped up on social media sites, you can get an edge in the stock market
